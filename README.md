# Treex

Treex is a highly modular NLP framework implemented in Perl programming language.

It is primarily aimed at Machine Translation, making use of the ideas and technology
created during the [Prague Dependency Treebank](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt2.0/) project.
At the same time, it is also hoped to significantly facilitate and accelerate development
of software solutions of many other NLP tasks, especially due to re-usability of the numerous
integrated processing modules (called blocks), which are equipped with uniform object-oriented interfaces.
