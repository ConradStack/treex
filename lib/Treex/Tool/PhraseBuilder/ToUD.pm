=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::PhraseBuilder::ToUD

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Derived from C<Treex::Core::Phrase::Builder>, this class implements language-
and treebank-specific phrase structures.

This class defines the UD dialect of dependency relation labels, including
some labels that are actually not used in UD but may be needed during the
conversion to denote relations that will later be transformed.

It is assumed that any conversion process begins with translating the deprels
to something close to the target label set. Then the subtrees are identified
whose internal structure does not adhere to the target annotation style. These
are transformed (restructured). Labels that are not valid in the target label
set will disappear during the transformation.

This class may also define transformations specific to the target annotation
style. They may or may not depend on a particular source style. Classes
derived from this class will be designed for concrete source-target pairs
and will select which transformations shall be actually performed.
