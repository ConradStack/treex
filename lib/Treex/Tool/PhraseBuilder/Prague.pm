=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::PhraseBuilder::Prague

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Derived from C<Treex::Core::Phrase::Builder>, this class implements language-
and treebank-specific phrase structures.

There are methods that detect structures in a Prague-style treebank (such as
the Czech Prague Dependency Treebank).

Transformations organized bottom-up during phrase building are advantageous
because we can rely on that all special structures (such as coordination) on the
lower levels have been detected and treated properly so that we will not
accidentially destroy them.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item build

Wraps a node (and its subtree, if any) in a phrase.

=item detect_prague_pp

Examines a nonterminal phrase in the Prague style. If it recognizes
a prepositional phrase, transforms the general nonterminal to PP.
Returns the resulting phrase (if nothing has been changed, returns
the original phrase).

=item detect_prague_coordination

Examines a nonterminal phrase in the Prague style (with analytical functions
converted to dependency relation labels based on Universal Dependencies). If
it recognizes a coordination, transforms the general NTerm to Coordination.
