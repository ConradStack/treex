=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::PhraseBuilder::StanfordToUD

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Derived from C<Treex::Core::Phrase::Builder>, this class implements language-
and treebank-specific phrase structures.

It expects that the dependency relation labels have been translated to the
Universal Dependencies dialect. The expected tree structure features Stanford
coordination and prepositional phrases headed by the preposition.
The target style is Universal Dependencies.

Input treebanks for which this builder should work include the Google Universal
Dependency Treebanks version 2.0 (spring 2014).

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item build

Wraps a node (and its subtree, if any) in a phrase.
