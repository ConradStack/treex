=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::ML::Classifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A role for classifiers. Every ML method (but it fits rule-based methods, too) 
which is a classifier should implement this role.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 To be implemented

These methods must be implemented in classes that consume this role.

=over

=item score

It assignes a score (or probability) to the given instance being
labeled with the given class.

=item all_classes

It returns all possible classes.

=back

=head2 Already implemented

=over

=item C<predict>

It picks the class with the greatest score, given an instance.
The methods C<score> and C<all_classes> are called inside this method.
