=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Phrase::PP> (standing for I<prepositional phrase>) is a special case of
C<Phrase::NTerm>. The model example is a preposition (possibly compound) and
its argument (typically a noun phrase), plus possible dependents of the whole,
such as emphasizers or punctuation. However, it can be also used for
subordinating conjunctions plus relative clauses, or for any pair of a function
word and its (one) argument.

While we know the two key children (let's call them the preposition and the
argument), we do not take for fixed which one of them is the head (but the head
is indeed one of these two, and not any other child). Depending on the
preferred annotation style, we can pick the preposition or the argument as the
current head.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item prep

A sub-C<Phrase> of this phrase that contains the preposition (or another
function word if this is not a true prepositional phrase).

=item arg

A sub-C<Phrase> (typically a noun phrase) of this phrase that contains the
argument of the preposition (or of the other function word if this is not
a true prepositional phrase).

=item prep_is_head

Boolean attribute that defines the currently preferred annotation style.
C<True> means that the preposition is considered the head of the phrase.
C<False> means that the argument is the head.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item head

A sub-C<Phrase> of this phrase that is at the moment considered the head phrase
(in the sense of dependency syntax).
Depending on the current preference, it is either the preposition or its
argument.
