=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Treex::Core::Document;
  use Treex::Core::Phrase::Term;
  use Treex::Core::Phrase::NTerm;

  my $document = new Treex::Core::Document;
  my $bundle   = $document->create_bundle();
  my $zone     = $bundle->create_zone('en');
  my $root     = $zone->create_atree();
  my $node     = $root->create_child();
  my $tphrase  = new Treex::Core::Phrase::Term ('node' => $node);
  my $ntphrase = new Treex::Core::Phrase::NTerm ('head' => $tphrase);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Phrase::PP> (standing for I<prepositional phrase>) is a special case of
C<Phrase::NTerm>. The model example is a preposition (possibly compound) and
its argument (typically a noun phrase), plus possible dependents of the whole,
such as emphasizers or punctuation. However, it can be also used for
subordinating conjunctions plus relative clauses, or for any pair of a function
word and its (one) argument.

While we know the two key children (let's call them the preposition and the
argument), we do not take for fixed which one of them is the head (but the head
is indeed one of these two, and not any other child). Depending on the
preferred annotation style, we can pick the preposition or the argument as the
current head.

It is questionable whether this phrase should actually be considered an
extension of C<Phrase::NTerm>. Because we would have to override the C<head>
attribute. Here it is not an attribute, merely a function. But we need two new
attributes, C<preposition> and C<argument>. These should be separated from the
ordinary children in the same fashion as C<head> is separated from the other
children of C<Phrase::NTerm>. We may also need an attribute for the current
head style (whether C<head()> should return the preposition or the argument).
