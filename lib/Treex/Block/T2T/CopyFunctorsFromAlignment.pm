=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::T2T::CopyFunctorsFromAlignment

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Project functor values through alignment links on the t-layer, e.g. golden functor values to automatically generated
t-trees of the same sentences, or source functors to target language.

The processed trees must already be aligned to other trees on the t-layer, which already have their functor values set.
This copies the functor values for all nodes that are aligned; if a node is not aligned and does not already have any functor
value, it is set to '???'.
