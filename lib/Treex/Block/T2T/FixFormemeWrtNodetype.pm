=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::T2T::FixFormemeWrtNodetype - 'x' formeme assigned to all non-complex nodes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Formemes other than "x" make sense only with complex nodes. However, the statistical formeme transfer
often assignes formemes such as "n:attr" e.g. to coordination/apposition nodes (nodetype="coap").
This block assigns the "x" formeme to all non-complex nodes.

TODO: what's the status of qcomplex (quasi complex, such as #Cor) nodes with respect to formemes?
