=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::T2A::ES::DeleteSuperfluousAuxCP

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Removing superfluous prepositions or conjunctions in coordinations. 

This is just a Spanish-specific setting for L<Treex::Block::T2A::DeleteSuperfluousAuxCP>.
It seems that conjunction "ni" requires repeated all prepositions.
