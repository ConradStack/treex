=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::T2A::ProjectChangedFormemes - 
project changed formemes from one a-tree to another.
(A Deepfix block.)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Assume that C<language=cs>, C<selector=Tfix> and C<to_selector=T> (as it is 
currently used in Deepfix).

The block is intended to be used in a setup where C<cs_T> t-tree is generated 
from the C<cs_T> a-tree, C<cs_Tfix> t-tree is a copy of C<cs_T> t-tree with some 
formemes changed, and C<cs_Tfix> a-tree is generated from C<cs_Tfix> t-tree.

The task it solves is to replace subtrees in C<cs_T> a-tree by subtrees from 
C<cs_Tfix> a-tree for each pair of subtrees that both correspond to a t-node with 
a formeme differing between C<cs_T> t-tree and C<cs_Tfix> t-tree.

T-trees in C<cs_T> and C<cs_Tfix> are isomorphic, but some of the formemes might 
differ. For each pair of t-nodes with a differing formeme, the corresponding 
lex and aux nodes must be changed.

First, the form and tag of the lex node in C<cs_T> a-tree (belonging to the C<cs_T> 
t-node) is replaced by the form and tag of the lex node from C<cs_Tfix> a-tree 
(belonging to the C<cs_Tfix> t-node) since there is 1:1 correspondence.

Then, the aux nodes belonging to the C<cs_T> t-node are removed from the C<cs_T> 
a-tree.

And finally, copies of the aux nodes belonging to the C<cs_Tfix> t-node are 
inserted into the C<cs_T> a-tree.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over

=item C<to_selector>

Selector of zone into which the changes should be projected.
This parameter is required.

=item C<alignment_type>

Type of alignment between the t-trees.
Default is C<copy>.
The alignemt must lead from this zone to the zone set by C<to_selector>.
(This all is true by default if the t-tree in this zone was created with 
L<T2T::CopyTtree>.)

=item C<log_to_console>

Set to C<1> to log details about the changes performed, using C<log_info()>.
Default is C<0>.
