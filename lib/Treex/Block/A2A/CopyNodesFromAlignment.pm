=head1 NAME 

Treex::Block::A2A::CopyNodesFromAlignment

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This block works on an a-tree which is monolingually aligned to another a-tree (used for "silver" generated
a-tree aligned to an automatic analysis tree).

It deletes all nodes from the a-tree that are not aligned to any node in the other tree and copies nodes 
from the other tree which are not aligned to any node in this tree.

=head1 TODO

Delete obsolete back alignment code.
