=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::A2A::CopyBasicToEnhancedUD

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In Universal Dependencies, there is basic and enhanced representation. The
basic representation is a tree and corresponds to the a-tree in Treex. The
enhanced representation is a directed graph and can be optionally stored in
wild attributes of individual nodes (there is currently no API for the
enhanced structure).

The enhanced graph is independent of the basic tree. It is not guaranteed that
all tree edges also exist in the enhanced graph. Therefore, if we want to work
with enhanced dependencies, we probably want to copy the tree to the parallel
enhanced structure first. That is what this block does.
