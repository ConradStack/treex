=head1 NAME 

Treex::Block::Align::FilterAlignment

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This block deletes some of the alignment links based on the given condition.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=item C<layer>

The layer of the aligned trees (default: a).

=item C<language>

The current language. This parameter is required.

=item C<selector>

The current selector (default: empty).

=item C<condition>

The condition that must be fulfilled so that the alignment link will NOT be deleted. 

The condition may be any Perl code returning a boolean value. You may use C<$a> as the source 
node, C<$b> as the target node and C<$type> as the alignment type. 

The condition defaults to 1, i.e. no nodes will be deleted in the default setting.

=item C<invert>

Invert the matching sense, i.e. if set to 1, all nodes fulfilling the given condition
WILL be deleted. Defaults to 0.
