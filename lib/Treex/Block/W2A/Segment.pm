=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::W2A::Segment - rule based segmentation to sentences

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # in scenario
 W2A::Segment use_paragraphs=1 use_lines=0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sentence boundaries are detected based on a regex rules
that detect end-sentence punctuation ([.?!]) followed by an uppercase letter.
This class is implemented in a pseudo language-independent way,
but it can be used as a base class for language-specific segmentation
by overriding the method C<get_segments>
(using C<around> see L<Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers>).
The actual implementation is delegated to L<Treex::Tool::Segment::RuleBased>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 use_paragraphs

Should paragraph boundaries be preserved as sentence boundaries?
Paragraph boundary is defined as two or more consecutive newlines.

=head2 use_lines

Should newlines in the text be preserved as sentence boundaries?
However, if you want to detect sentence boundaries just based on newlines
and nothing else, use rather
L<W2A::SegmentOnNewlines|Treex::Block::W2A::SegmentOnNewlines>.
