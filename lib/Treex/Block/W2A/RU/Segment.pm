Treex::Block::W2A::EN::Segment

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sentence boundaries are detected based on a regex rules
that detect end-sentence punctuation ([.?!]) followed by a uppercase letter.
This class adds an English specific list of "unbreakers",
i.e. tokens that usually do not end a sentence
even if they are followed by a period and a capital letter.
