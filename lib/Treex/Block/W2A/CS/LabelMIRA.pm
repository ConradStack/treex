=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::W2A::CS::LabelMIRA

=head1 DECRIPTION

Mira labeller adjusted to labelling Czech sentences.
Just a lightweight wrapper for
L<Treex::Block::W2A::LabelMIRA> which is the labeller itself.

Uses a rather small and simple model, which is good only for testing and toy
examples.
Use e.g. C<model_name=pdt_labeller_best> to get good results.
