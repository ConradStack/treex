Infinitives attached as complements to other verbs are usually labeled C<xcomp>
because their subject is controlled by the parent verb.

However, in some languages there are periphrastic forms of future tense that
consist of the infinitive of the main verb and a finite form of an auxiliary
verb. Subjects of these verb groups are not controlled because the combination
verb+auxiliary as a whole is finite. If it happens to complement another verb,
it must be labeled C<ccomp> and not C<xcomp>.
