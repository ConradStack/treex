The relations C<mwe> and C<flat> are both used in flat structures of two or
more nodes belonging to the same multi-word expression or name. The first word
is the head and the other words are attached to it using the C<mwe> or C<flat>
relation.

The head may have other children, too. If there are other children, they are
understood as modifying the entire multi-word expression. However, one node
cannot have a mix of C<mwe> and C<flat> children. It cannot participate in two
different multi-word expressions at the same time. Moreover, C<flat> is used
with proper nouns, C<mwe> is used with function words, and one word cannot be
both.
