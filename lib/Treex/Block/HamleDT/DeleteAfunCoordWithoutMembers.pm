=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::HamleDT::DeleteAfunCoordWithoutMembers - fix inconsistent coordinations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If a node is marked with afun=C<Coord>, but there are no conjuncts (is_member=1)
among its children, then the afun is changed to C<NR> (not recognized).
This approximation is useful for situations when
the is_member attribute is more reliable than afun.
