=head1 NAME 

Treex::Block::HamleDT::Transform::StanfordObjects -- relabel objects according to
Standford Dependencies style.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If there is only one object, it is the direct object and should get C<dobj>
label instead of the more general C<obj> label. Otherwise, we do not know as of now, so we keep the label as it is.
(Probably C<obj>, but potentially some previous block might
have found out whether it is a direct or indirect object, so maybe the label is
already the correct specific one.)
