=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::Tutorial::StemTamil - Tamil suffix splitting

=head1 NOTE

This is just a tutorial template for L<Treex::Tutorial>.
The current implementation only creates flat a-trees.
You must fill in the code marked as YOUR_TASK.
The solution can be found in L<Treex::Block::Tutorial::Solution::StemTamil>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When processing agglutinative languages,
many NLP tasks (such as SMT) profit from a pre-processing,
where suffixes are separated from word stems,
so the suffixes can be handled as separate tokens.

This block should do this pre-processing for Tamil.
The real work will be done by a tool L<Treex::Tool::Stemmer::TA::Simple>.
You can read the documentation for this module by typing:

 perldoc Treex::Tool::Stemmer::TA::Simple


You can test this block with:

  echo 'enakku patikkiRa pazakkam irukkiRaTu' \
   | treex -Lta Read::Sentences Tutorial::StemTamil Write::Sentences

It should print "ena +kku pati +kkiR +a pazakkam iru +kkiR +aTu".
