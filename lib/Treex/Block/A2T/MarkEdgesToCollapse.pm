=head1 NAME 

Treex::Block::A2T::MarkEdgesToCollapse - prepare a-trees for building t-trees

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This block prepares a-trees for transformation into t-trees by filling in
two attributes: C<is_auxiliary> and C<edge_to_collapse>.
Each node marked as I<auxiliary> will not be present at the t-layer as a t-node.
It will collapse to its I<lexical> node according to C<edge_to_collapse>.
Generally, prepositions, subordinating conjunctions, and modal verbs
collapse to one of their children.
Other auxiliary nodes (aux verbs, determiners, commas,...) collapse to their parent.
Before applying this block, afun values must be filled (especially Aux* and Coord).

This block is supposed to serve as a base class for language specific blocks.
It could be also used directly in scenarios as a baseline language independent block.
