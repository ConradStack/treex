=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::A2T::CS::SetFunctors

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets functors in tectogrammatical trees using a pre-trained machine learning model (logistic regression, SVM etc.)
via the ML-Process Java executable with WEKA integration.

Pre-set configurations with default paths to trained models for Czech and English are available
as L<Treex::Block::A2T::CS::SetFunctors> and L<Treex::Block::A2T::EN::SetFunctors2>, respectively.
